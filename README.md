In this project, I developed a web application that performs image classification using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend is built with Flask, handling the server-side logic and interaction with the image classification model. I used Python to implement the classification model, integrating machine learning techniques to identify and categorize images based on predefined classes. The frontend is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to upload images and view classification results in real-time. The project demonstrates the integration of machine learning into a web-based platform, providing efficient and accurate image classification.
